## Welcome to CloverSalad

#### The unofficial Creature of the Deep assistant

---

CloverSalad provides detailed information about each fish found in the mobile game Creatures of the Deep. 

Here, you will find information on 

- the weight of the fish 
- their specific characteristics
- the locations where you are most likely to find them
- and a converter weight <> points 
### Contributions are (very) welcome

The information gathered here is probably very approximate, imprecise, and possibly inaccurate for some. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, even in a contemptuous tone :)

COTD is a difficult game, whose mechanics are hidden and that we must discover together.
